            "The vendor's authoritative identification of the
            network management subsystem contained in the
            entity.  This value is allocated within the SMI
            enterprises subtree (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an
            easy and unambiguous means for determining `what
            kind of box' is being managed.  For example, if
            vendor `Flintstones, Inc.' was assigned the
            subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242, it could assign the
            identifier 1.3.6.1.4.1.4242.1.1 to its `Fred
            Router'."
